Team Members: Nishit Prasad and Divyasree Sadhukhan

A two-team project in which we worked on the implementation of concurrent data structures (stacks and linked lists) as well as on the analysis of performance and their fairness limitation.

The implementation is done on the basis of multithreading in Java language with the operations of storing and organizing data in shared memory in an effective manner involving mutual exclusion locks and lock-free scenarios.

The following are the respective file names for the respective implmentations as shown below:

Lock-Based LinkedList	:	LockBasedListThread.java
Lock-Free LinkedList	:	LockFreeListThread.java
Lock-Based Stack	:	LockBasedStackThread.java
Lock-Free Stack		:	LockFreeStackThread.java

The respective testings are done based on changing the "n" values which imply the number of operations for Push/Insert and Pop/Remove.
